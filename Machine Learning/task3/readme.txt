# OCR from Video

This project demonstrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on live video streams using EasyOCR and OpenCV. It captures video from your system camera, performs OCR on each frame to detect text, and overlays bounding boxes with recognized text on the video feed.

## Introduction

The project uses EasyOCR, a deep learning-based OCR library, to recognize text from live video frames captured using OpenCV. It detects text in real-time, draws bounding boxes around the detected text, and displays the processed video feed with overlaid text and bounding boxes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ocr-from-video.git
   cd ocr-from-video
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   - Install OpenCV:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python-headless
     ```
   - Install EasyOCR:
     ```bash
     pip install easyocr
     ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python ocr_from_video.py
   ```

2. The script will open your system camera and start capturing video. It will perform OCR on each frame, detect text, and display the processed video with bounding boxes and recognized text overlaid on top.

3. Press 'q' to exit the video feed and close the application.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV: Used for capturing video frames from the system camera and processing them.
- EasyOCR: Used for performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the captured video frames.
