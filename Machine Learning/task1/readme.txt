# Stock Price Prediction Project

This project demonstrates a simple stock price prediction model using historical stock market data and technical indicators. The model utilizes the Linear Regression algorithm to forecast future stock prices.


## Introduction

The objective of this project is to build a machine-learning model that predicts the closing price of a stock based on historical data. The features used for prediction include 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Volume'.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is historical stock market data. The data should be in CSV format and include the following columns: 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume', and 'Close'.

Example of the dataset:

| Open | High | Low | Volume | Close |
|------|------|-----|--------|-------|
| 1234 | 1245 | 1220| 10000  | 1240  |
| 1250 | 1260 | 1230| 15000  | 1255  |
| ...  | ...  | ... | ...    | ...   |

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the historical stock market data file (`A.csv`) in the `task1/stocks/` directory.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python predict_stock_price.py
   ```

3. The script will load the data, train a Linear Regression model, make predictions, and print a data frame comparing the actual and predicted closing prices.

## Results

After running the script, you will see a DataFrame printed to the console showing the actual and predicted closing prices for the test data.

Example output:
```
    Actual  Predicted
0    1240      1245.5
1    1255      1250.2
...   ...        ...
```
