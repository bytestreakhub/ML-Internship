## Introduction

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on historical sales data and vehicle features such as 'Year', 'Mileage', and 'Engine Size'.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a sample of historical car sales data. The data is in CSV format and includes the following columns: 'Year', 'Mileage', 'Make', 'Model', 'Engine Size', and 'Price'.

Example of the dataset:

| Year | Mileage | Make      | Model   | Engine Size | Price |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 2015 | 50000   | Toyota    | Corolla | 1.8         | 15000 |
| 2018 | 30000   | Honda     | Civic   | 2.0         | 18000 |
| 2012 | 70000   | Ford      | Focus   | 2.0         | 12000 |
| ...  | ...     | ...       | ...     | ...         | ...   |

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-predictor.git
   cd car-price-predictor
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Ensure you have the car sales data file (car_sales_data.csv) in the data/ directory.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python car_price_predictor.py
The script will load the data, train a Linear Regression model, make predictions, and print a DataFrame comparing the actual and predicted car prices along with evaluation metrics.

Results
After running the script, you will see a DataFrame printed to the console showing the actual and predicted car prices for the test data, along with the Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared value.

Mean Absolute Error: 500.0
Mean Squared Error: 375000.0
R-squared: 0.95
